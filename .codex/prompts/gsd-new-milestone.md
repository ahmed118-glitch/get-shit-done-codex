argument-hint: "[milestone name, for example v1.1 Notifications]"

## Objective
Start a new milestone cycle — update PROJECT.md and route to requirements

## Compatibility
- Use .codex/skills/get-shit-done-codex semantics.
- Treat upstream workflow as the source of truth.
- Replace user-specific paths with workspace-relative paths (.claude/..., .planning/...).
- Run engine commands through PowerShell: 
node .claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js ...
- Parse JSON with ConvertFrom-Json; parse key/value output when workflow uses KEY=value raw mode.
- No jq / bash-only constructs.

## Execution
1. Parse "[milestone name, for example v1.1 Notifications]" from the user input.
2. Run init:
node .claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js init new-milestone --raw

3. Load .claude/get-shit-done/workflows/new-milestone.md and execute it step-by-step.
4. Translate each Task(...) in workflow into:
   - spawn_agent with the matching role file context from .claude/agents/.
   - wait for each spawned agent and apply returned output before moving forward.
5. Preserve all gates and routing from upstream workflow.
6. Preserve commit behavior using 
node .claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js commit "message" --files ....
7. If commit preflight fails (no git / no commit flag), proceed in read-only mode and report clearly.

## Completion output
- Summarize key artifacts created/updated and next recommended command.
